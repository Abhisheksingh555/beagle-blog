      <p class="description">
        The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
        The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense 
        of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog 
        for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is 
        intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
